	<h2>I'm ds797, a student, programmer, and designer.</h2>
	<p>I love deep-diving into subjects I don't know much about, then coming out the other side brimming with knowledge. The universe, nature, and technology are some of my favorite subjects!</p>
	<p>I'm very passionate about programming, I understand how it works and I see limitless potential. I enjoy writing terse but readable code that performs its job well.</p>
	<p>I love designing user interfaces and implementing them through my programming skills. It's a great way for me to challenge myself, and I enjoy the journey of creating an experience as much as the result.</p>
